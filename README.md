</div>

## About

ResumeTeX is a LaTeX resume template designed for ATS (application tracking system). It is clean and simple, with a focus on readability and ATS compatibility.

The template is designed to be easy to use and customize. It includes a number of components that can be easily added or removed.

## Idea

A common dilemma:  

- **Applicant**: I want my resume to pass ATS screening and impress human interviewers.  
- **Human Interviewer**: I want a well-crafted resume with no vague claims or exaggerations.  
- **ATS**: I filter out unqualified candidates using specific but hidden keywords.

However,

However:  

- To survive ATS screening, resumes need to include more keywords to increase the chances of matching.
- To impress human interviewers, resumes must be clear, concise, and reduce unnecessary information.

How to solve this dilemma?

- **Invisible text**: Include invisible text in the resume to improve ATS screening results.
- **Visible text**: Focus on the visible text to impress human interviewers.

***Invisible text for ATS is meant to improve screening results. All information, visible or invisible, must be TRUE. Visible details should be those you want to discuss, while invisible ones should also be accurate but focus on optimizing keyword matches.***
